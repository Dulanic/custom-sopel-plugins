# custom-sopel-plugins

These are some [Sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel) plugins I've written. While `custom.py` is very, very specific to my chat, the rest are pretty generic and a great addition to any IRC channel.

## 8ball.py
Just a standard, run-of-the-mill [magic 8-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball). Never lies.

## animals.py
Posts random animal pics from several different APIs.

## colors.py
Moved from [sopel-color-text](https://github.com/xnaas/sopel-color-text) â€” don't want to actually deal with publishing to pypi in the future.

## custom.py
Custom commands for [Action Sack](https://actionsack.com)'s Sopel bot. Many of these are highly inappropriate.

## dadjokes.py
Uses the [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to post dad jokes.

## nsfw.py
RNG of NSFW things.
