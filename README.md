# custom-sopel-plugins

These are some [Sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel) plugins I've written. While `custom.py` is very, very specific to my chat, the rest are pretty generic and a great addition to any IRC channel.

### Deprecated Plugins

These plugins are deprecated and no longer used or updated.

#### [imgur.py](https://github.com/xnaas/custom-sopel-plugins/blob/master/deprecated/imgur.py)
This was abandoned because the Imgur API isn't great for this purpose.

Use [img.py](https://github.com/xnaas/custom-sopel-plugins/blob/master/img.py) instead.

Used the [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/) to post image results to chat.
